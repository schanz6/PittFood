PittFood
========

Android application that randomly picks restaurants (stating at my college campus) based on categories.

How you can help

This project is very much in its first stage so really anything that you can add would help. Things I want to do in the 
future includes better graphics, more fetures and maybe even adding google api to be abel to work everywhere.

Notes
This project was built using Eclipse with its android plug in. If you have any questions eithor comment or send me an email
